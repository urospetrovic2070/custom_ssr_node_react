This is a little example of how to implement server-side rendering using React.js and Node.js.
## Things that were done:
- Webpack bundler configured for server and client.
- Client-side React.js application that uses react-router-dom to map the components to specific urls.
- Server-side Express.js application that takes the basic HTML template from the client and renders the content for the specific url.
- Server React DOM API is used for rendering on the server for static markup.
